- [Active Directory Enumeration](AD_Enumeration.md)
- [Active Directory Lateral Movement](AD_LateralMovement.md)
- [Active Directory Credential Harvesting](AD_CredentialHarvesting.md)

>**Note:** This documention is very very basic and I am maintainting it for my personal references (for clearing a specific exam ðŸ˜œ). There are a lot of better that covers these topic and much more about Active Directory security in much more depth. I will link the resouces which I have found.
