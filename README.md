>**Note 1:** This documention is very very basic and I am maintainting it for my personal references (for clearing a specific exam). There are a lot of better resources that covers these topic and much more about Active Directory security in much more depth. I will link the resouces which I have found.

> **Note 2:** Throught this notes, `<>` is used as a placeholder which is meant to be replaced by the user with appropriate value. Without replacing these, commands won't work
